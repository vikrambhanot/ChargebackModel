Dear Chris,
I hope this message finds you well. As we approach the end of the fourth quarter, I wanted to reach out with an update on market conditions and your portfolio.
Market Overview
The markets have experienced volatility in recent months due to various economic factors including interest rate decisions and geopolitical events. While past performance is not indicative of future results, it's important to maintain a long-term perspective aligned with your financial goals.

Based on our last review, your portfolio remains positioned according to your risk tolerance and investment objectives. I recommend we schedule a meeting to:

Review your current asset allocation
Discuss any changes in your financial situation or goals
Ensure your investment strategy remains aligned with your needs
Address any questions or concerns you may have

Next Steps
Please reply to this email or call my office at (555) 123-4567 to schedule a convenient time for our review meeting. I typically have availability on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.
